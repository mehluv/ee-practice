The Conjuring is a 2013 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wan.[3] Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga star as the Warrens, paranormal investigators and authors associated with prominent cases of haunting. Their reports inspired the Amityville Horror.[4] The Warrens come to the assistance of the Perron family (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor), who are experiencing increasingly disturbing events in their farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971.[5]

The Conjuring was released in the United States and Canada on July 19, 2013, and in the United Kingdom and India on August 6, 2013. Considered by critics and audiences to be one of the scariest films since 1973's The Exorcist, the film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $318 million worldwide from its $20 million budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror films of all time. A sequel to the film, titled The Conjuring: The Enfield Poltergeist, is scheduled to be released on June 10, 2016.[citation needed]
